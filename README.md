# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a website with latest information about Mars. All of the information for this website including images and a table were gathered from other websites using web scraping. This project required learning more about using HTML and understand which components were specific to what was going to be scraped. All of the data gathered for this website was stored using MongoDB and hosted on a webpage using Flask. The latest news article about Mars was scraped from "www.redplanetscience.com", the featured image was scraped from "www.spaceimages-mars.com" and the table of facts about Mars was scraped from "www.galaxyfacts-mars.com". Finally, the four hemispheres of Mars were scraped from "www.marshemispheres.com". All of the components of this project had to work together in order for this project to work and a big portion was learning to understand HTML and creating a web page from scratch.
